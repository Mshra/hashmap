# Hashmap

Programmed the [Hashmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20hash%20table,that%20maps%20keys%20to%20values.), data structure from scratch using C.

---

- Used the [FNV-1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) for building hashes.
- Avoids collision using [Linear Probing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing) technique.
- Able to perform operations and call methods such as,
    - Insert
    - Delete
    - Print

**How does it work?**

## Hashing(FNV-1a) - from wikipedia
```
    hash := FNV_offset_basis

    for each byte_of_data to be hashed do

        hash := hash XOR byte_of_data
        hash := hash Ã— FNV_prime

    return hash 
```

We start by defining elements in the Hashmap i.e. A key-value pair and call it **Item**.

## Programming the Hashmap
```c
typedef struct {
  char *key;
  int32_t value;
  int isEmpty;
} Item;
```
Using this, we define a constant called **NULL_ITEM** to avoid handling with garbage values,
present in the set of Hashmap.
```c
const Item NULL_ITEM = {NULL, 0, 1};
```

Now creating a Hashmap data type using struct which is defined as
```c
typedef struct {
  int length;
  Item map[];
} Hash_Map;
```

Initiliaze the empty hashmap with length of 1 and **NULL_ITEM** as its 1 element.
and dynamically check for following three conditions during insert operation.

- if index of the key is less than length of hashmap and the Item at that index is a NULL_ITEM.
- if index of the key is equal to the length of the hashmap(we get out of bounds), hence a new hashmap is required with length twice that of the previous one. Insert all the elements of the old hashmap in the new one with the index suitable with that of the new one.
- if another non-null item is present at the index i.e. collision occurs, we perform linear probing and check for a empty space, till we run out of the space in the hashmap. This now becomes the situation of above case and can be dealt with the above solution.
